## üß© Situation
As part of the **DevOps Hackathon (Phase 1)**, I was responsible for deploying an **Online Shopping Portal** to the internet.  
The main goal was to ensure the website was **accessible, reliable, and scalable**, capable of handling user traffic efficiently.  

This involved:
- Using **DevOps automation tools** to develop the deployment process  
- Reducing manual effort and improving system performance  
- Setting up the **necessary infrastructure**  
- **Automating deployments**  
- Ensuring smooth real-time application performance

## üéØ Task

### Core Objectives:
- Develop the **required infrastructure** for the Online Shopping Portal  
- Clone the **necessary code and artifacts**, ensuring **security and accessibility**  
- Strategize a **deployment plan** to bring the application online  

### Supporting Goals:
- Gather all required resources for the project  
- Implement automation scripts  
- Use **Docker** to build and deploy a real-world application  
- Gain strong **hands-on experience** with DevOps tools
